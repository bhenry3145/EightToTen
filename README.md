Design an API based on mini challenges from the Combine:
Also, each one must have their own service file, inside a Service folder
Data Validation is required.

Endpoints:

1. Magic 8 Ball: create a endpoint generates 8 unique responses. One controller


2. Guess It: create 3 endpoints (one controller) that takes an input, then outputs if the number is higher or lower than the number guessed.
Easy Mode 1-10
Medium Mode 1-50
Hard Mode 1-100

3. Restaurant Picker: create 1 endpoint that takes an input and generates a Randomly Generated Restaurant based on the category chosen. 10 Restaurants per category.

  All in all the endpoints work as intended. My only nitpicks are maybe changing the route input to tell the user what the choices are, and have a .toLowercase so the user can use upper and lowercase. Other then those everything is working fine. Teseted in swagger and postman. Good Job.
